Firecracker Workers space Attempt starts out within a start budget. The runtime holds a start, warm claims included, while two Attempts are still in their first 60 seconds or the host's I/O pressure (io "some" avg10) is at 30% or more, for at most 120 seconds, in arrival order. The Agent forwards the state in its heartbeat, and `/runs-on` answers the fallback with reason `over-start-budget` while every ready Worker is over budget. On ubuntu0, six Attempts starting together held I/O stall at 40 to 60% for minutes and slowed tests on every job. `ERAINFRA_MAX_STARTING`, `ERAINFRA_START_WINDOW_S`, `ERAINFRA_IO_PRESSURE_LIMIT` and `ERAINFRA_MAX_START_HOLD_S` change the limits; `docs/workers.md` has the details. Deploy the control plane before the Agent: an older control plane rejects the new heartbeat field.
