/**
 * The agent build this deployment installs.
 *
 * EraInfra ships as one product: tagging `v<version>` publishes an immutable
 * `erainfra-agent-<version>.tar.gz` asset, and machines install
 * exactly that asset. Nothing tracks a branch, so a machine installed today and
 * a machine installed next month run identical bytes.
 *
 * This constant is the fleet's rollout pointer. The deterministic packager
 * makes the archive checksum available before tagging, so the release commit
 * pins it here and the tag workflow refuses to publish different bytes. Deploy
 * only after the matching release asset exists; rolling the fleet back is the
 * same edit with the previous release values. Because the install script is
 * served by this deployment over TLS, `sha256` is a trust root outside the
 * release itself, so an archive that matches the release but not this pin is
 * rejected.
 *
 * `infraAgent` is the same pin for the Node side, and the trust root that replaces the Infra
 * Agent's unverified download. v0.2.0-rc.6 was the first release to publish those binaries, and
 * every release since carries the pin: the five digests are generated from the sidecars with
 * `pnpm --filter @erainfra/backend print-infra-agent-pin` rather than typed by hand, and the
 * release workflow refuses to publish a tag whose pin disagrees with the bytes it just built.
 * Every target `INFRA_AGENT_TARGETS` names has to be covered — a pin missing one platform would
 * leave that platform installing bytes nothing vouches for, so the tag gate rejects a partial map
 * rather than an empty one.
